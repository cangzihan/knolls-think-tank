## 简介
Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency that started as a joke but has grown to become one of the more well-known cryptocurrencies. Here’s an overview of what you need to know about Dogecoin:

### Origins and History
- Created in 2013: Dogecoin was created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. It was inspired by the popular "Doge" meme, which features a Shiba Inu dog and humorous, multi-colored text in Comic Sans font.
- Purpose: Initially, it was intended to be a fun, less serious alternative to Bitcoin, with a larger supply and lower individual coin value.

### Key Features
- Blockchain: Dogecoin operates on its own blockchain, which uses a proof-of-work consensus algorithm similar to Bitcoin's but based on the Scrypt algorithm, which is less energy-intensive.
- Supply: Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no cap on the total supply of coins, which has led to over 130 billion DOGE in circulation as of 2023.
- Community and Use Cases: Dogecoin has a strong and active community. It has been used in various charitable events and fundraising campaigns. It's also popular for online tipping and microtransactions due to its low transaction fees.
